Hey there! My name is Cade Brown, and I'm a developer, I specialize in numerical programming, Programming Language Theory (PLT), and audio/video/signal processing.

This is my personal blog, where I post about maths, programming, music, and other happenings around the world. I hope you enjoy!



## Projects


## MAGMA (Matrix Algebra on GPU and Many-core Architectures)

  * This is my current (as of Jan 2020) project, which I have been given the task of porting to AMD GPUs (right now, it relies on NVIDIA).
  * This is my largest project, in terms of reach, and will be a large part of the [Frontier](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/frontier/) HPC system, which will only have AMD GPUs.

See [MAGMA](https://icl.utk.edu/magma/) for more information


## "Know It All", an A.I. writer

[Demonstration of "Know It All", an A.I. writer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwGsRskWN-I)

  * This was my, along with Jakob Liggett's, submission to VolHacks IV, in which an AI model trained on internet text posts "completes" your thoughts.

You can see the (currently in a somewhat-messy state) source [here](https://github.com/ml-bois).


## SimpleSummit, a distributed computing project 

  * Check out our website, here: [https://simplesummit.github.io/](https://simplesummit.github.io/)
  * I did all the software for this, which included writing a fractal explorer which ran on 8 different machines at once, which communicated in real time over a network to produce an image around 30 frames per second. 
  * This was a main project I worked on during my internship at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), for my 11th and 12th grade summers.

# Employment

Additionally, for reference, here is my (approximate) employment record:


## Research Assistant @ ICL (Summer 2019 - Present)

Since I've started attending UTK, I've worked at ICL (Innovative Computing Laboratory). Within ICL, I work under Dr. Stan Tomov in the Linear Algebra (LA) division. Our task has been porting and accelerating common LA operations on the new AMD HIP/ROCm stack.


## Intern @ ORNL (Summer 2016 - Summer 2017)

For 2 summers, I worked as an intern at ORNL (Oak Ridge National Laboratory). There, I helped write SimpleSummit ([https://simplesummit.github.io/](https://simplesummit.github.io/)), including the fractal rendering program, the website
